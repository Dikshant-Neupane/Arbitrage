# REAL_STATE – Real Estate Arbitrage Scanner

## Objective
Build an automated system that:
- Scrapes real estate data from the web  
- Cleans and structures the data  
- Analyzes properties for undervaluation (arbitrage opportunities)  
- Stores results in a database for long-term use  

This project is designed to master:
- Python programming logic  
- Data engineering pipelines (ETL)  
- Web scraping  
- Data cleaning and analysis  
- SQL as application memory

## Phase 1: Data Pipeline Foundation (Completed)

A complete automated pipeline was built using an ETL model:

Internet
↓
Scraper (modules/scraper.py)
↓
Raw CSV (data/raw/raw_properties.csv)
↓
Cleaner (modules/cleaner.py)
↓
Cleaned CSV (data/cleaned/cleaned_properties.csv)
↓
Database Loader (modules/database.py)
↓
SQLite Database (data/properties.db)

## Modules Description

| Module | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `scraper.py` | Scrapes data from a website and saves raw CSV |
| `cleaner.py` | Cleans data and calculates price per square foot |
| `database.py` | Stores cleaned data into SQLite database |
| `main.py` | Runs the entire pipeline in one command |

## Current Capabilities

- Automated scraping  
- Automated data cleaning  
- SQLite database storage  
- One-command execution of full pipeline
