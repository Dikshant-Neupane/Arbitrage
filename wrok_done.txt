# REAL_STATE – Real Estate Arbitrage Scanner

## Objective
Build an automated system that:
- Scrapes real estate data from the web  
- Cleans and structures the data  
- Analyzes properties for undervaluation (arbitrage opportunities)  
- Stores results in a database for long-term use  

This project is designed to master:
- Python programming logic  
- Data engineering pipelines (ETL)  
- Web scraping  
- Data cleaning and analysis  
- SQL as application memory

## Phase 1: Data Pipeline Foundation (Completed)

A complete automated pipeline was built using an ETL model:

Internet
↓
Scraper (modules/scraper.py)
↓
Raw CSV (data/raw/raw_properties.csv)
↓
Cleaner (modules/cleaner.py)
↓
Cleaned CSV (data/cleaned/cleaned_properties.csv)
↓
Database Loader (modules/database.py)
↓
SQLite Database (data/properties.db)

## Modules Description

| Module | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `scraper.py` | Scrapes data from Craigslist and saves raw CSV. Extracts price, sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms from titles. |
| `cleaner.py` | Cleans data, filters out rentals/spam, calculates price per sqft, categorizes property types |
| `database.py` | Stores cleaned data into SQLite database |
| `analyzer.py` | Detects undervalued properties and saves arbitrage opportunities |
| `main.py` | Runs the entire pipeline in one command |

## Current Capabilities

- Automated scraping from Craigslist real estate  
- Smart extraction of sqft/bedrooms/bathrooms from listing titles
- Rental filtering (removes monthly rentals, keeps only sales)
- Automated data cleaning and deduplication
- Property type categorization (Commercial, Land, Multi-Family, etc.)
- Price per sqft calculation  
- Undervalued property detection (arbitrage opportunities)
- SQLite database storage  
- One-command execution of full pipeline

Phase 2 :
The system now detects undervalued real estate opportunities using market-based pricing logic and stores them as structured intelligence in the database.

Updates made on Jan 27, 2026:
- Fixed scraper to work with new Craigslist HTML structure
- Added regex extraction for sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms from titles
- Improved cleaner to filter out rental listings (under $50k or /reb/ URLs)
- Fixed analyzer column mismatch (area vs area_sqft)
- Added property type categorization
- Better formatted output with summary statistics
